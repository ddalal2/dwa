Project 3 Proposal - Javascript<br></h3>
<br>
<h3>Proposal - www.findcongress.com </h3> 
<p>This election season has been a circus. Regardless of political affiliation, the common sentiment seems to be frustration, distrust, and anger that Congress and local governments are not doing their jobs. Part of the issue is the overwhelming feeling that there isn't much you can do to affect the legislative process.</p> 
<p>
For this project, I'd like to create tool that allows the user to locate the congressmen/women and senators for their state. The tool would also provide contact information (email, phone, and social media) for each government official listed and the ability to email the government official's using the official's contact form.</p>
