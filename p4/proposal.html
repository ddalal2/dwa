<h1> P4: Project Proposal </h1>

<h2>Project Title: Tweet-Suite: Social Media Dashboard </h2>
<h2> Updated Projects: </h2>
<p>While trying to implement OAuth for the Twitter API plugoin, I ran into a series of problems with CURL. While, I was able to resolve the CURL issues, I had lost significant time and would not have the time to implement the project as orginally intended.

The new project is to implement a Twitter monitoring tool that is an amalgam of Monitter.com and Geoshirp. Monitter allows the user to generate realtime twitter timelines based on search queries. The user can moniter realtime twitter data for multiple queries. Geochirp allows the user the moniter geoencoded tweets and tweets near a specifed location.

My site would allow the user to create multiple twitter feeds based on either a simple search or a geo-search. The simple search would allow the user to search by hashtag, twitter handle or search term. The geo-search would prompt the user for a search query, location, and radius. On the backend, the app would geocode the location and display the tweets related to the search query within the selected radius.

<h2> Old Description </h2>
<p>For project 4, I am going to create a simple social media dashboard that will allow the user to their Twitter account and mine Twitter for social data. Through the dashboard the user will be able to schedule tweets, generate custom feeds to monitor hashtags and users, generate simple reports on the user's social influence.</p>
<p>The goal is create a small utility that I scale to support additional social media sites like Facebook, Tumblr, Formspring, and Instagram. While many free and commerical solutions exist, currently none on the market are targetted for nonprofits. My hope is to make this site accessible and useful for nonprofits looking to develop a social media strategy. </p>
