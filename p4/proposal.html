<h1> P4: Project Proposal </h1>
<strong>Dhairya Dalal</strong>
<h2>Project Title: Tweet-Suite: Social Media Dashboard </h2>
<h2> Description </h2>
<p>For project 4, I am going to create a simple social media dashboard that will allow the user to their Twitter account and mine Twitter for social data. Through the dashboard the user will be able to schedule tweets, generate custom feeds to monitor hashtags and users, generate simple reports on the user's social influence.</p>
<p>The goal is create a small utility that I scale to support additional social media sites like Facebook, Tumblr, Formspring, and Instagram. While many free and commerical solutions exist, currently none on the market are targetted for nonprofits. My hope is to make this site accessible and useful for nonprofits looking to develop a social media strategy. </p>
<strong> Resources </strong>
There are several social media dashboards. Below is small list of existing tools:
<ul>

</ul>
